        <h1>Collect Images. Go to the Library.</h1>

        <p>After taking a walk through Thinking Machines, I went back up to the library to visit with Jenny Tobias to follow up with a question I had earlier. I was curious about art that sat at the intersection of vector graphics and photography. </p>

        <p>Hours later, I was neck deep in art I couldn't have possibly imagined, much less Googled… Jenny had pulled literally <em>dozens</em> of works, notably: original(!) Bauhaus magazines, deep Kurt Schwitterz and Andy Warhol cuts, and modern digital art books such as <a href="http://www.stresspress.biz/product/pixel-stress"><em>Stress Press</em></a> by Anouk Kruithof, <a href="https://mishkahenner.com/Dutch-Landscapes"><em>Dutch Landscapes</em></a> by Mishka Henner, and <a href="http://libraryoftheprintedweb.tumblr.com/"><em>Library of the Printed Web</em></a> by Paul Soulellis. </p>

        <p>Although I was blown away by the breadth of material, I still didn't feel like I had found quite what I was looking for, and Jenny could tell from my reactions. The works were all just a bit left or right of that graphical-photographical sweet spot I was after. Struggling to find words to refine our search, I resorted to taking out my laptop and pulling up some images from a folder I've been adding to for the last few years. </p>

        <p>After going through those images, even though she said that what I'm looking for doesn't quite fit a category, Jenny (with the help of a colleague) pointed me to some incredible, inspirational works:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Irving Penn's <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/irving-penn-food-photography-vogue-archive">frozen food photography</a></li>
        <li>Lorenzo Vitturi's <a href="http://www.lorenzovitturi.com/a-dalston-anatomy/"><em>Dalston Anatomy</em></a></li>
        <li>Michael Najjar's <a href="http://www.michaelnajjar.com/artworks/high-altitude#1"><em>High Altitude</em></a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>These three pieces, not only showed me what I was looking for, but also recontextualized my initial question. Sure, <em>visually</em> I was looking for graphical-photographical interaction, but I was actually curious about the <em>philosophical</em> gray area between digital and analog, where art can be surprising and playful, yet deeply compelling. And these works absolutely exemplify that idea. </p>

        <p>Only through conversation with the <strong>extremely</strong> knowledgable and helpful Jenny Tobias and staff at the MoMA Archives and Library could I have figured that out. </p>
